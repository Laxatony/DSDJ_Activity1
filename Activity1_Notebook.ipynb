    "In our employee retention problem, rather than simply predicting whether an employee will leave the company within a certain time frame, we would much rather have an estimate of the probability that he/she will leave the company. \n",
    "We would rank employees by their probability of leaving, then allocate a limited incentive budget to the highest probability instances. \n",
    "\n",
    "Consider employee turnover domain where an employee is given treatment by Human  Resources because they think the employee will leave the company within a month, but the employee actually does not. This is a false positive. This mistake could be expensive, inconvenient, and time consuming for both the Human Resources and employee, but is a good investment for relational growth. \n",
    "\n",
    "Compare this with the opposite error, where Human Resources does not give treatment/incentives to the employees and they do leave. This is a false negative. This type of error is more detrimental because the company lost an employee, which could lead to great setbacks and more money to rehire. \n",
    "Depending on these errors, different costs are weighed based on the type of employee being treated. For example, if itâ€™s a high-salary employee then would we need a costlier form of treatment? What if itâ€™s a low-salary employee? The cost for each error is different and should be weighed accordingly. \n",

    " - We can rank employees by their probability of leaving, then allocate a limited incentive budget to the highest probability instances.\n",
